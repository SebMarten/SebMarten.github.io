								In the realm of politics, my curiosity extends far beyond the borders of my native Germany, driving me to explore international perspectives and understand the global landscape. I frequently turn to CNN for its broad coverage of global events, appreciating the depth and diversity of viewpoints it offers. Equally, as a German, I hold a deep respect for the tagesschau and other national outlets that keep me connected to the local socio-political discourse. This blend of international and local sources enriches my understanding, allowing me to see the intricate interplay of politics on a global stage, and fuels my passion for dissecting political strategies, policies, and their implications on societies worldwide.</p>

								Infrastructure fascinates me, especially monumental projects that redefine landscapes and human connectivity. Channels like B1M captivate me with stories of engineering marvels and the challenges overcome in their creation. A project that stands out is the Fehmarn Belt tunnel, an ambitious undertaking aiming to significantly improve European transport links. Such feats of engineering not only showcase human ingenuity but also highlight the complexities and importance of thoughtful, sustainable infrastructure development. This passion for infrastructure is not just about the marvel of construction but also about understanding the impact of these projects on economic development and environmental sustainability.</p>

								Urban mobility and the quest for eco-friendly city designs are topics I explore with great enthusiasm, particularly through the lens of the channel Not Just Bikes. This platform offers insightful commentary on how cities can transform to accommodate more sustainable forms of transport, emphasizing the significance of bike-friendly infrastructure and pedestrianized spaces. The channel's critical look at urban planning and mobility solutions inspires me to think about the future of urban living, advocating for designs that prioritize environmental health and the well-being of residents. This interest in urban mobility extends to a broader concern for the planet, driving me to advocate for cities that not only move people</p>

								<h1>Side Project: due2grow <br />
								<!--<p>Aenean ornare velit lacus varius enim ullamcorper proin aliquam<br />

								In my time at Dublin City University, I embarked on a fascinating side project that blended my interests in technology and sustainability. Along with my classmates, we founded due2grow, a fictional startup aimed at revolutionizing the agriculture industry through technology. Our project, born from the New Enterprise Development Project class, focuses on improving seed quality assessment using advanced machine learning techniques.</p>
							<p> Imagine being a farmer with the power to predict exactly which seeds will grow into the healthiest plants. That is what due2grow is all about. We developed a product named Germinator that uses a type of machine learning, specifically a supervised learning model, to analyze seeds and predict their germination outcomes. By simply scanning seeds, farmers can now determine which ones are most likely to thrive, ensuring better crop yields and sustainability. This method is not only more accurate but also faster than traditional assessment techniques.</p>
							<p> This project is exciting because it represents a significant leap forward in agricultural practices. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning algorithms with farming, we're not only helping farmers make better decisions but also contributing to a more sustainable future in food production. It is a perfect example of how technology can be used to solve real-world problems, improving efficiency and outcomes in one of the world's most important industries.</p>
