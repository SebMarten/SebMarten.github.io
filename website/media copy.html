							<p>	The episode suggests that there is a place for people who may not come from a traditional STEM background which is highly interesting for me as a business student. This inclusion broadens the scope of perspectives in data-driven decision-making and emphasizes the importance of diverse analytical approaches. Understanding strategies and tactics for non-technical analysts to thrive in a technical domain can be empowering and offers a roadmap for leveraging unique strengths in the analytical field. The mention of bootstrapping, not in the traditional programming context, but as a metaphor for self-starting and learning, resonates with the proactive approach needed in analytics education and career development.	</p>

							<p>After hearing much about Tableau's prowess in data visualization, I decided to expand my business analytics skill set by learning how to use it. Mo Chen's "Tableau portfolio project" video was a perfect starting point. I dove into the process of building an interactive dashboard, importing data, and creating diverse visualizations, like line charts that elucidate sales trends, and histograms that reveal price distributions. The inclusion of a calendar widget as a filter particularly intrigued me—it offered a dynamic way to sift through time-based data. This capability is indispensable for making strategic business decisions, as it allows for real-time analysis and forecasting. By learning to construct and publish a dashboard, I gained the ability to present data in an engaging, informative manner. This skill is not just an addition to my portfolio; it's an essential component of modern business analytics that turns data into dialogue.</p>

								<h1>Going beyond Business Analytics<br />

							<p>In my view, business analytics should also be aware of other areas of data analytics. Haziqa Sajid (2023) highlights this in the context of politics, specifically the transformative role of AI-driven data analytics in political campaigns, illustrating its relevance to data and business analytics with examples from the US elections. The use of AI in the Obama and Trump campaigns to target voters and tailor outreach strategies highlights the critical impact of data analytics in understanding and influencing voter behaviour. It is a powerful testament to how data analytics can optimise strategies across a range of sectors, including politics, by leveraging big data for precise audience targeting and personalised communications.  </p>
							<p>However, the text also warns of the potential misuse of data, highlighting the dangers of generative AI in producing misleading content, deep fakes and misinformation. This raises significant ethical concerns about data privacy, the integrity of democratic processes, and the potential for AI to create an uneven playing field in elections. The misuse of AI-driven data analytics can undermine public trust, manipulate election outcomes, and threaten national and electoral security, as noted by US Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.</p>
							<p>The double-edged nature of AI and data analytics in politics underscores the need for robust ethical standards and regulatory frameworks to ensure transparency, protect voters' privacy, and maintain the integrity of electoral processes. It serves as a cautionary tale for data analysts and business professionals to advocate for the responsible use of data, and to be vigilant against the potential for data to be exploited for unethical purposes.</p>
