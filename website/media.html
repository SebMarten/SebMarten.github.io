By emphasizing a harmonious relationship between technology and humanity, the discussion underscores the necessity for analytics professionals to incorporate ethical considerations into their data-driven strategies. This approach not only enhances the trustworthiness and acceptance of AI solutions across various stakeholders but also ensures that technological advancements contribute positively to society. </p>

						<p>	The episode suggests that there is a place for people who may not come from a traditional STEM background which is highly interesting for me as a business student. This inclusion broadens the scope of perspectives in data-driven decision-making and emphasizes the importance of diverse analytical approaches. Understanding strategies and tactics for non-technical analysts to thrive in a technical domain can be empowering and offers a roadmap for leveraging unique strengths in the analytical field. The mention of bootstrapping, not in the traditional programming context, but as a metaphor for self-starting and learning, resonates with the proactive approach needed in analytics education and career development.	</p>

						<p>After hearing much about Tableau's prowess in data visualization, I decided to expand my business analytics skill set by learning how to use it. Mo Chen's "Tableau portfolio project" video was a perfect starting point. I dove into the process of building an interactive dashboard, importing data, and creating diverse visualizations, like line charts that elucidate sales trends, and histograms that reveal price distributions. The inclusion of a calendar widget as a filter particularly intrigued meâit offered a dynamic way to sift through time-based data. This capability is indispensable for making strategic business decisions, as it allows for real-time analysis and forecasting. By learning to construct and publish a dashboard, I gained the ability to present data in an engaging, informative manner. This skill is not just an addition to my portfolio; it's an essential component of modern business analytics that turns data into dialogue.</p>

						<p>On my blog, I often talk about AI. Although this video is a bit older, Andrew Ng's TED Talk on democratizing access to artificial intelligence was deeply inspiring, especially the concept of making AI accessible to businesses of all sizes, not just large tech companies. Ng's vision of enabling even local pizza shops to use AI to predict the best-selling flavors on any given day underscores a crucial shift towards leveraging technology to enhance decision-making, productivity, and profitability across the board. This approach is paramount for Business Analytics because it underscores the potential of AI to transform decision-making processes, making them more data-driven and efficient. By democratizing AI, businesses can harness the power of their data to optimize operations, forecast trends, and tailor their offerings to meet customer demand more accurately. This not only opens up new avenues for innovation and competition but also contributes to a more dynamic and resilient economy.</p>
