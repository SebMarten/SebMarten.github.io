								<h1>Sentiment Analysis in R<br /></h1>
								<p>In this project, I aimed to learn more about Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis in particular in R.</p>
							</header>
							<p>	The dataset in question originates from Kaggle and entails around 1.6 Million posts from Twitter, a popular social media platform where users post messages, known as tweets. This particular dataset comprises tweets annotated for sentiment, classified as either negative (0) or positive (4). Each entry contains the sentiment target, a unique identifier for the tweet (ids), the date of the tweet, a flag (which typically remains unused in analysis), the user handle, and the tweet text itself. Such datasets are instrumental in understanding public sentiment and can be used for various applications, from market analysis to political sentiment analysis. </p>

							<p>	The initial step involves loading the dataset using R's read.csv function, followed by renaming the columns for clarity and ease of access. Preliminary checks for missing values and duplicates were conducted, ensuring data integrity. The summary() and sapply() functions facilitated a detailed assessment of missing values, while sum(duplicated(dataset)) was used to check for any duplicate entries. This process is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of the dataset before further analysis. </p>

This accessibility fosters a data-driven culture within organisations, where more stakeholders can use data to inform strategic decisions. The democratisation of data analytics signifies its evolution into a critical, everyday business tool that improves decision quality and business agility, underscoring the importance of analytics in today's business practices.</p>-->

							<p>	Given the constraints of local computing resources, a subset of 1000 random rows was sampled from the original dataset. This sampling step was necessary to ensure that the subsequent data processing and analysis could be performed efficiently on a smaller scale while still providing meaningful insights. The sampled dataset maintains a representative diversity of sentiments, enabling effective training and testing of machine learning models. </p>
							<h2>Example</h2>
							<pre><code># Sample 1000 random rows from the dataset
sampled_dataset <- dataset %>% sample_n(1000)</code></pre>

								<p>	The preprocessing of text data involved converting the tweet text to UTF-8 encoding to standardize character representation. Following this, a corpus was created from the text column, and the text data underwent further preprocessing, including tokenization, where the text was broken down into individual words or tokens. This process also involved cleaning steps such as converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, numbers, and common stopwords, which are words typically filtered out before processing natural language data.</p>

							<h2>Example</h2>
							<pre><code># Convert the text data to UTF-8 encoding
sampled_dataset$text <- iconv(sampled_dataset$text, to = "UTF-8")
# Create a corpus from the text column
corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(sampled_dataset$text))</code></pre>	
<hr />
							<p>	After tokenization, a Document-Term Matrix (DTM) was generated to convert the textual data into a structured, numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 20% for testing. This split is essential for evaluating the performance of the machine learning models on unseen data, ensuring that the models learn to generalize from the training data.
								<br/><br/> Two machine learning models were trained on the processed dataset: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Naive Bayes model, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks, achieved an accuracy of 50.5%. Thus, for a sample of 1000, the Naive Bayes algorithm is unable to confiendtly predict sentiments. On the other hand, the SVM model, achieved a higher accuracy of 69.5%. This improvement seems to show the SVM's ability to better capture the complexities of sentiment analysis in textual data for this exercise. Both models' results were compiled into respective data frames, showcasing the actual vs. predicted sentiments, and highlighting the challenges and potential of using machine learning for sentiment analysis in social media data.</p>
